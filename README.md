# Open Artifacts

Open Artifacts is an npm-workspace TypeScript project.

The template intentionally leaves `apps/web` empty. Choose Next.js, Vite, Astro, Remix, or another web stack when a real project needs one.

```

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run e2e
npm run eval
npm run build
```

The four quality contracts are stable: `lint` is static analysis, `test` is unit testing, `e2e` is integration testing, and `eval` runs real-model evaluations. Run each command explicitly; `eval` remains separate because it uses model credentials and may incur cost. See `docs/quality-gates.md` for CI and credential boundaries.

On the first install in a repository created from this template, `npm install` derives the project name from the clone directory and updates the root package name, workspace package scope, lockfile, README, dependencies, and Git hooks. Later installs are idempotent. To override the derived scope or title, set `ONEE_PROJECT_SCOPE` or `ONEE_PROJECT_TITLE` on the same command.

```bash
ONEE_PROJECT_SCOPE=acme ONEE_PROJECT_TITLE="Acme Product" npm install
```

## GitHub Template Setup

From `onee-workspace`, create and initialize a public product repository with one command:

```bash
make create-product name=my-product
```

For a repository created directly through GitHub's template interface, clone it into the intended project directory and run `npm install` before beginning product work.

See `docs/bootstrap.md` for the setup checklist.
